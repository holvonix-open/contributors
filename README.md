# Contributing to Holvonix LLC open-source projects

Where and as permitted under applicable open-source software licenses, feel free to use, fork, and modify our open-source repositories.  If you'd like to contribute your modifications back to our projects, however, we'll need a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) in place.  One agreement will apply to your contributions to any Holvonix LLC project.

At this time, we currently only offer an Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA), so you cannot submit work that your employer has rights to.  New contributors must sign the latest version: [__ICLA v1.6 PDF__](/clas/individual-cla-v1.6.pdf)

How to submit your Contributor License Agreement - choose one:
1. If you reside in the United States or the EU, help us go green and use Adobe Sign! Create an Issue on this repository with your name, e-mail address, and country and the title "Please send me the ICLA v1.6 via Adobe Sign" so we can follow up.  Note: Adobe Sign collects and makes part of the public audit record your IP address and other metadata if you go this route.
2. Paper - Enter your info into the PDF, print it, sign and date it manually, and scan it.

Finally, regardless of which option you choose, open a pull request to submit the executed agreement as `signed/icla/v1.6/[username].pdf` to this repository so our CLA tracker bot will let you make PRs. If the name of the PDF and the GitHub usernames you use to submit the signature pull request, provide on the CLA, and use to submit to our repositories don't all match up, the tracker bot will get confused, so please check for typos.  Per the CLA, the information you provide on the CLA and any metadata collected during execution will be publicly available.

Holvonix LLC cannot provide legal advice regarding your rights or responsibilities, including but not limited to whether or not your employer may have rights to intellectual property you create. You are encouraged to seek your own legal counsel.

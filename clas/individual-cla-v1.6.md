"You" (or "Contributor" or "Your") shall mean the Copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the Copyright owner that is making this Agreement with HOLVONIX. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

"Party" shall mean You or HOLVONIX.

"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is Submitted by You to HOLVONIX for inclusion in, documentation of, or improvement of any of the projects or products owned, maintained, or managed by HOLVONIX (the "Work"), including but not limited to projects hosted at:

__Section 2. Grant of Copyright License.__  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to HOLVONIX and to all Other Recipients a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable, fully-sublicensable (through any number of tiers of sublicensees) Copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

__Section 3. Grant of Patent License.__

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to HOLVONIX and to all Other Recipients a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section), fully-sublicensable (through any number of tiers of sublicensees) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer Your Contribution(s), the Work, and the combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was Submitted, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was Submitted.

If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity (but not to any other entity) under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

__Section 4. Waiver of Royalties.__
To the maximum extent possible, You hereby forever waive any right to collect royalties from HOLVONIX or from any Other Recipient for the exercise of any rights licensed in this Agreement, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. You agree not to Submit any work for which royalties are not fully waived.

__Section 5. Waiver of Moral Rights.__
To the maximum extent possible, You hereby forever waive and agree never to assert any Moral Rights (if any) that You may have in or with respect to any of Your Contributions. "Moral Rights" means any and all rights of paternity, integrity, disclosure and withdrawal and any other rights that may be known as or referred to as "moral rights," "artistâ€™s rights," "droit moral," or the like.

HOLVONIX and each Other Recipient may (but shall have no obligation to), at its sole discretion, identify You as a contributor to the Work and/or as the author of Your Contributions.

If Your employer(s) or any other third party ("Rights Holder") has rights to intellectual property that You create that includes your Contributions, You represent and warrant that each such Rights Holder has (i) waived such rights for your Contributions to HOLVONIX or (ii) executed a separate Corporate Contributor License Agreement with HOLVONIX.

__Section 8.__
You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, and EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES IN SECTION 7, YOU PROVIDE YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

__Section 9.__

You agree that HOLVONIX has no responsibility, and cannot be held liable, for any acts or omissions of any Other Recipient, any sublicensee, or any other third party.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, HOLVONIX SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE OR GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES) RESULTING FROM OR RELATING TO ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARISE FROM WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, REGARDLESS OF ANY NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

__Section 10.__
You agree to notify HOLVONIX of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make any of Your representations inaccurate in any respect.  Notifications to HOLVONIX may be sent by e-mail to <cla@holvonix.com>.

__Section 11.__
HOLVONIX may, in its sole discretion, with or without notice to You, and at any time, (i) decide whether or not to incorporate any of Your Contributions into the Work and/or (ii) change its decision.  HOLVONIX's decision not to incorporate Your Contribution into the Work does not limit, terminate, waive, void, or revoke any of the licenses granted by You or any other provision of this Agreement.

__Section 12.__

You agree that You are responsible for all work Submitted using the GitHub Username and/or E-mail Address indicated below and that, as between You and HOLVONIX, all such work shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as Your Contribution.

You further agree that the previous paragraph does not limit Your Contributions to only those works Submitted using the Github Username and/or E-mail Address indicated below and that this Agreement applies to all of Your Contributions, whether or not they are Submitted using the GitHub Username or E-mail Address indicated below.

__Section 13. General.__

This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California (USA), without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions or Your state or country of residence. The provisions of the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement.

This Agreement supersedes and replaces any and all previous agreements between HOLVONIX and You regarding Your Contributions.

Execution of this Agreement in no way creates, nor shall this Agreement be interpreted as creating, an employment, agency, partnership or joint venture between You and HOLVONIX.

The headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be interpreted to limit or otherwise affect the provisions of this Agreement.

Any rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting Party shall not be employed in interpreting this Agreement.

Neither a failure nor a delay on the part of either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege.

To the maximum extent possible, if any provision of this Agreement is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Agreement without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
